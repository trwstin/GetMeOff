# NextStop
A bus alert application focused on improving accessibility for people with disabilities.
This web app is just a prototype to demonstrate the core features of NextStop.

## Problem Statement
How might we, as a community empower, equip and co-create with persons with disabilities to enable them to access, use, and enjoy places, services, products and/or information, whether physical or virtual, so that persons with disabilities can connect to and be included in the wider community?

## Inspiration
People with disabilities face challenges in alighting at the desired stops as not all public transport are equipped with accessibility features.
Since we take the bus everyday to school, we wanted to build something which makes public transport more accessible for the disabled community.

## What it does
It takes in a bus stop as an input and calculates the travelling distance from the user's current point.
When the user is within a minute away from their destination, the application vibrates to signal the user to get off soon.

## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS and JS.

## Challenges we ran into
We wanted to develop the application on Android Studio and Swift but could not pick up the skills in time, so we decided to build our MVP in the form of a web application instead.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Hack For Good 2023 is the first hackathon for 3/4 of our team, so we are proud to have completed a product within a short period of time.

## What we learned
Apart from the languages used to build the app, we also learned how to use collaborative tools on GitHub and Figma.

## What's next for GetMeOff
Create the mobile application version!
